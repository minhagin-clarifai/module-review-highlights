5,"This is perfect for me. A two step stool isn't always high enough and I dread digging out a 6ft step ladder. It holds up nicely to weight, feels very secure as you stand on it. I even stood on the top step and it was still solid and sound. Very easy to open and close. The little pocket on top is nice. Would love to see an attachable tray added to hold a drill, pencil, tape measure and screws. My only little complaint is the top plastic seems to not hold up to any dings. Aside from that, love it.",Sturdy Step Stool,2022-10-18T02:36:02.000+00:00,DeannaB

5,"Gorilla Ladders 2-Step PRO-Grade Steel Step Stool, 300 lbs. Load Capacity Type IA Duty Rating review: This small step stool is tough and extremely strong. It has a tool platform at the top which is useful for when working on your home walls inside such as mounting shelving. It is stout! It can also take a beating and just keep working. I have another Gorilla ladder that is for outside and Gorilla ladders are just super strong and safe. I have included some pictures that show another use for the ladder - as a work platform for tools and fasteners. I was putting up a shelf in our hall and this ladder worked great as a tool and toolbox holder (that way I do not have to bend over as much). It is just great! I love Gorilla ladders!

5,"This little ladder is a big improvement over the step stool I was using. I can see why it has a 300lb capacity. Both the steps and the heavy steal frame are quality. The ladder looks and feels very sturdy. But, with that load capacity does come with some weight. It is not a light aluminum ladder. It is a little on the heavy side especially for the ladies. I love the top where you can set all your tools and everything you need for the job your doing. There are non skid treads on the steps for sure footing. I would recommend this for all the around the house small jobs.

5,"Lightweight and strong. I got this to replace a cracked 1970s model which had come with our house. This is significantly lighter, because it's all plastic, but it doesn't appear to be any less strong. It's easy to transport where needed. I was initially surprised when I stepped on it that the seat/top step wasn't snapped into place - you have to push down until it clicks. Once it's clicked into its locked position, it's nice and sturdy. It has wide feet for sturdiness and the handle is useful for climbing or carrying. Recommended.",Lightweight and strong.

5,"Gorilla Ladders 2-Step PRO-Grade Steel Step Stool, 300 lbs. Load Capacity Type IA Duty Rating

A great overall step ladder; excellent for kitchen use which is exactly why I ordered it. It arrived safely, although not in a box, but in a plastic bag, which was torn upon receiving, but no damage occurred.

The ladder is made of steel, and has rubber feet, adorned in yellow, for safety notice, and it has a shelf on it that is made of resin. The shelf will hold items in its pan. The steps are wide and broad, which allow sure footings. The steps are reinforced on the sides, and through the linkage. The back is also braced. Total height allows an estimated 8' 1"" reach. Excellent for kitchens and laundry rooms, garages, or other places where low reach is needed beyond normal reach.

I'm very happy with the ladder. Well made. Easily stored. Great colors. Awesome!

I recommend this item. I rate this item 5*s out of 5.

5,"I ordered this only to have a stepladder in the storage space beside the house and ended up tossing out the other stepladders!
Gorilla is a great brand. I use a number of their products, but wasn't really thinking about that when I put in the order for this stepladder. I simply wanted to have a ladder handy in the storage space where the water heater lives. We keep a lot of the household maintenance items there...paint, bulbs, etc. on shelves that go up to the roof. I was tired of fetching the stepladder from the wood shed or the one from inside whenever I needed to replace a bulb or an electrical socket. 
When this arrived, I knew right away it would be my favorite step ladder. You wouldn't think such a thing as ""favorite"" applies to step stools, but it can happen when you get a Gorilla!
It's totally safe. The materials and the bolts holding it together provide a solid perch that does not wobble one bit. A hand lever must be engaged to open or close the ladder, which automatically locks into the open position. The steps are wide and, because they are heavy duty plastic, are never slippery like the metal step stool we kept in the laundry area. 
The thing that really won me over is the tool bucket. It's a small space, to be sure, but it fits all kinds of tools. The top edge has holes that fit a nice selection of screwdrivers, marking pencils, and even a slot for the clip on a measuring tape or other slim tool. 
So much better than I had anticipated from a simple step ladder! Great job, Gorilla brand!",I ordered this only to have a stepladder in the storage space beside the house and ended up tossi...,2020-01-23T22:09:26.000+00:00,Laine

The frame is strong tubular steel and the joints are secured with metal rivets. The reinforced extra wide steps and oversize feet allow me to feel balanced and comfortable even when reaching up to 8 feet high. It also has a raised tool tray which is very useful and I can also lean against it when on the top step. It has a lever for easy opening and closing and the closed storage depth is less than 4 inches.

5,"Very solid and well-designed step stool for DIYers or pros. I keep this in the house for fixing lights, fans, painting and any sort of project where I need some extra height. Construction is very solid, it doesn't shift, is wide (2 feet) and hard to tip over. The steps have a great grip and the top step is nice and large. The project top is very convenient. Instead of putting tools in my pocket or mouth, I can place them in the little storage container. When I am not using it, the stool collapses for convenient storage. A simple button/latch opens/closes the step stool. 

Reach height is a comfortable 8' 1"" which is perfect for my 8 ft ceilings. The height to the first step is 9"", second step/platform is 19"". Collapsed depth (width) is 2.5"". Feet are nice with sturdy rubber grips. The only slight downside to this step stool is it is a little heavy, coming in just over 12 lbs.

5,"Gorilla 2-step Steel Ladder 

This is a very well constructed ladder. I needed a smaller ladder to reach into kitchen cabinets that go to the ceiling, reaching the top shelf was not possible. I also wanted one that was easy to store, the storage depth on this ladder is only 3.8 inches, which is perfect for the closet I want to store it in. It’s very easy to unfold (I’ve had some that weren’t so easy), it has larger feet making it more stable and also the material the feet are made of make them very safe for all floor types. The steps are wider than a lot of the ladders out there. On the top of it there is a small area where you could hold small tools/screws or whatever, very convenient if you have a small repair. It has a 300lb load capacity and come with a Limited Lifetime Warranty. I would highly recommend this ladder.",,2020-01-22T17:33:50.000+00:00,Cm

5,"I purchased this step stool because I did not want to collect disability for the rest of my life by using the cheap little 200lb rated 2 stepper I had at home. I have been up and down this stool on all 3 steps and it feels extremely solid with no swaying or shaking, no bending steps when you step on them, and no rattling. My balance is great with the extra large steps. I weigh 240lbs and I feel completely safe on this step stool. I don't need my wife standing next to me and handing me light bulbs or holding screws or screwdrivers for me anymore because of the little built in tray. I was always worried about my last stepper breaking on me and slipping my vertebrae in every direction or breaking my hip when I fell, but I don't worry one bit anymore with this Gorilla 3 stepper. So glad I purchased it, I have complete peace of mind now when I have to step up for a job around the house, it's like walking up a staircase. If I could change one thing about this stepper it would be to have a metal skeleton on the underside of each step especially where the screws/bolts fit in, but don't let this sway you from purchasing this step stool because I would purchase it again just as it is.

5,"This is a terrific 3-step steel stool! It's sturdy, with a wide work platform, non-slip rubber steps and feet, built-in tool tray and nice secure snap latch. A very nice safety feature is the neon yellow stripe on the edge of each step. I found the yellow stripe very helpful in a low-lit basement to find the ladder. However, once on the ladder I couldn't see the neon yellow but it's a great idea. It holds up to 300 lbs and feels very sturdy. It's a tremendous value for the added functionality of a platform-like step stool. I use this ladder for painting, sheetrock, handing pictures, casement,... and I love the platform area. This ladder would be even more amazing if it had a magnetic feature in the tool tray to hold fasteners and/or metal tools. It folds up nicely for storage into approximately a 4"" width.

There are 3 good-sized steps with the top now being extra big - more of a small platform, which is nice working from. You can actually move around a little bit safely. It has a 300 lbs capacity and my 185 lbs felt very stable. The beam on top has a descent size tray for holding stuff. There is an easy to use handle that locks the stool open and unlocks it when you pull it. The feet have thick rubber covers so it doesn't slide and won't scratch or mark you floors. It folds up nice and slim to easily fit in a closet or it can be hung up. Its also light enough to carry around the house with out any trouble.
